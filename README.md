# Scene-recognition-with-bag-of-words
he goal of this repository is to introduce you to image recognition. Specifically, we will examine the task of scene recognition starting with very simple methods -- tiny images and nearest neighbor classification -- and then move on to more advanced methods -- bags of quantized local features and linear classifiers learned by support vector machines.
